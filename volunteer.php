		<li>Food/supplies delivery to Pet Project clients</li>
		<li>Transportation to vet and grooming appointments</li>
		<li>Food donation pickup</li>
		<li>Foster care</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What services will I be assigned to?</h2>
		
		<p>As a volunteer you can designate the types of pet services you want to provide and the number of hours and days you have available.</p>
